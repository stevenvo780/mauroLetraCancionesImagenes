I'm not good at goodbyes
I miss the sunshine in your eyes
Who said Cowboys don't cry?
Come on baby, let's take one last ride
We're riding around this carousel

If you catch my drift

We're riding around this wagon wheel

She took me for a spin

We're riding around this carousel

Getting dizzy 'til we're sick

Love is like a circle

There's no easy way to end



It's too much, I can't take anymore

Stuck feeling like we've been here before

But now the sun stopped shining here in the Wild West

My heart stopped beating, it has sunk into my chest



We're riding around this carousel

If you catch my drift

We're riding around this wagon wheel

She took me for a spin

We're riding around this carousel

Getting dizzy 'til we're sick

Love is like a circle

There's no easy way to end



Just an outlaw who only had one friend

I wonder if I'll ever see her face again

Dark clouds hanging over, they follow where I've been

My Cowboy tears are still blowing in the wind



We're riding around this carousel

If you catch my drift

We're riding around this wagon wheel

She took me for a spin

We're riding around this carousel

Getting dizzy 'til we're sick

Love is like a circle

There's no easy way to end



I'm not good at goodbyes

I miss the sunshine in your eyes

Who said Cowboys don't cry?

Come on baby, let's take one last ride



We're riding around this carousel

If you catch my drift

We're riding around this wagon wheel

She took me for a spin

We're riding around this carousel

Getting dizzy 'til we're sick

Love is like a circle

There's no easy way to end
